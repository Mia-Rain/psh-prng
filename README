psh-prng
-- an attempt at pure POSIX sh random number generation
-- 100% POSIX compliant; if /dev/urandom is missing PIDs are used
---
xoroshiro64**
-- this branch implements xoroshiro64**
-- hopefully this will have less issues the patterns 
---
Notes
-- DO NOT use this for encryption
-- I am unable to verify if this algorithm is secure
-- additionally if PIDs are used for seeds, generation can likely be manipulated
