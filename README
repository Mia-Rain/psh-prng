psh-prng
-- an attempt at pure POSIX sh random number generation
-- 100% POSIX compliant; if /dev/urandom is missing PIDs are used
---
Usage
-- ./ran [seed] [seed2] [method]
-- seed
  >> can either be a number or string
  >>>> if a string is given the decimal ascii value
  >>>> of each character is added together and used as the seed 
-- seed2
  >> xoroshiro64 expects 2 seeds
-- method
  >> pid or uran
  >>>> pid
  >>>>>> pids are used to generate a seed
  >>>> uran
  >>>>>> uses /dev/urandom if present to generate a seed

Seed generation
-- the code used here to generate a seed is hand made
---- uran is highly preferred as pids can be easily manipulated
---- and are sequential unless the system has random pids
---- however this isn't(?) present on Linux
  >> random pids causes a performance hit
  >> and it is widely debated if it has any actual use

xoroshiro64**
-- this branch implements xoroshiro64**
-- hopefully this will have less patterns 
---
Notes
-- DO NOT use this for encryption
-- I am unable to verify if this algorithm is secure
-- additionally if PIDs are used for seeds, generation can likely be manipulated
